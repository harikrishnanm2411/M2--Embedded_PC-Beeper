# Introduction
Tiny console utility runs on windows that beeps motherboard speaker via WinRing0 driver IO port read/write feature. This utility only support hardware platforms that have System Speaker device You can check out this in Device Manager: Set View to Resources by type, then select Input/Output (IO), checkout port 0x61, it should be System Speaker, otherwise this utility won't work on your platform.It is characterized by the distinctive "beeps" and "squeaks" that it can be made to produce and is therefore sometimes referred to as the "PC Beeper" or the "PC Squeaker".

## SWOT Analysis
## Strength
Cost Advantage. It can prevent from fire accidents

## Threats
Advanced featured in PC beeoer are already in the market. Decreasing Market Demand

## 4W's and 1H
## Why
To reduce the Pc from over heating. It can be used at one place.

## Where
This can be used in our Laptops. We can use it in the Mobiles, Tabs, etc.

## Who
Can be used as a reference for advanced Pc beeper systems.

## When
When overheating is going to occur these beeper can be used. This project is used to prevent Laptop from fire accidents.

## How
It sense the memory and gives an system sound as an output. It will be helpful in preventing fire accidents in any places.
